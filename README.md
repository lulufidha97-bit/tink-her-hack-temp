### Project Description
Cloth Matching & Outfit Tracker is a smart fashion assistant web application that helps users mix and categorize their wardrobe, and get outfit suggestions based on color combinations and style preferences. It solves the daily dilemma of "what to wear" by digitizing your closet.
### The Problem statement
Many people struggle to decide what to wear daily. They forget what clothes they own, find it difficult to match outfits properly, and often end up repeating the same combinations.
### The Solution
This app allows users to:
- Upload and store their clothes digitally.
- Get smart, randomized outfit suggestions.
- Save favorite combinations for easy access.
- Track previously worn outfits.
